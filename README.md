Analyze PGN Games. Collect some interesting statistics. 

Chess is a awesome game. With 10^120 different possible chess games. Its a perfect game to cause some stress to the system. 
Teaching a computer to play chess involves
I) Evaluating a position in a game of chess
II) Finding the next best move in the list of available moves 
 
Analyzing the PGN (Portable Game Notation) files is one good way to uncover some interesting statistics form the chess game. Analyzing these PGN's helps in uncovering
interesting heuristics, which can help in pruning.

 and many more...!!!!
